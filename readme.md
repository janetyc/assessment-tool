KEY ALGORITHMS
--------------
‚Ä¢ Smart Reference Detection: Identifies reference sections by detecting academic 
  section headers at page boundaries and intelligently separating content

‚Ä¢ Style Detection Engine: Uses multi-pattern matching with confidence scoring
  to identify citation styles based on formatting patterns, punctuation, and structure

‚Ä¢ Component Extraction: Style-specific parsing algorithms extract bibliographic
  components (authors, titles, years, etc.) for detailed analysis

‚Ä¢ Format Validation: Rule-based validation checks citations against academic
  style guidelines and reports errors/warnings

VALIDATION FEATURES
------------------
‚úì Missing author information detection
‚úì Publication year validation and formatting
‚úì Title presence and formatting checks
‚úì Style-specific punctuation validation
‚úì Reference completeness assessment
‚úì Style consistency across document
‚úì Google Scholar verification links

OUTPUT & REPORTING
-----------------
The tool generates comprehensive reports including:
‚Ä¢ Total reference count and distribution
‚Ä¢ Citation style breakdown with percentages
‚Ä¢ Individual reference analysis with confidence scores
‚Ä¢ Format validation results with specific errors
‚Ä¢ Component extraction details
‚Ä¢ Style consistency warnings
‚Ä¢ Downloadable text reports for documentation

PROFESSIONAL USE CASES
---------------------
üéì Academic Research: Validate citations in research papers and dissertations
üìö Educational Assessment: Check student paper citation quality and consistency  
üìù Manuscript Review: Verify reference formatting before journal submission
üîç Quality Assurance: Systematic citation analysis for institutional standards
üìä Style Compliance: Ensure adherence to specific academic style guidelines

LIMITATIONS & CONSIDERATIONS
---------------------------
‚Ä¢ PDF quality affects text extraction accuracy
‚Ä¢ Complex citation formats may require manual verification
‚Ä¢ Style detection confidence varies with citation complexity
‚Ä¢ Network-dependent features require internet connectivity
‚Ä¢ Rate limiting prevents excessive external service calls

TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------
Common Issues:
‚Ä¢ No references found: Check PDF has extractable text and clear reference section
‚Ä¢ Low confidence scores: Complex or non-standard citation formats may need manual review
‚Ä¢ Style inconsistencies: Mixed citation styles require editorial attention
‚Ä¢ Network errors: Check internet connection for external validation features

For best results:
‚Ä¢ Use PDFs with clear, machine-readable text
‚Ä¢ Ensure reference sections are clearly marked
‚Ä¢ Verify citations follow standard academic formats
‚Ä¢ Use consistent citation style throughout document

TECHNICAL SUPPORT
----------------
This tool is designed for academic and research purposes. For technical issues:
1. Verify PDF quality and text extractability
2. Check citation format against standard style guides  
3. Review debug information in application tabs
4. Use manual verification options when automated detection fails
