KEY ALGORITHMS
--------------
- Advanced Reference Detection: Multi-pass algorithm that:
  - Detects reference headers with various prefixes (page numbers, section numbers)
  - Handles complex formats: "Page 15 References", "7. References", "Appendix A: References"
  - Identifies references without explicit headers using content pattern analysis
  - Supports references anywhere in document, not just at page boundaries

- Enhanced Reference Format Support: Extracts references in multiple formats:
  - Bracketed numbers: [1] Author, A. (2023). Title...
  - Numbered with periods: 1. Author, A. (2023). Title...
  - Plain numbers: 1 Author, A. (2023). Title...
  - Author names: Author, A., Co-author, B. (2023). Title...
  - Et al. format: Authorname et al. (2023). Title...

- Style Detection Engine: Uses multi-pattern matching with confidence scoring
  to identify citation styles based on formatting patterns, punctuation, and structure

- Component Extraction: Style-specific parsing algorithms extract bibliographic
  components (authors, titles, years, etc.) for detailed analysis

- ormat Validation: Rule-based validation checks citations against academic
  style guidelines and reports errors/warnings

LIMITATIONS & CONSIDERATIONS
---------------------------
- PDF quality affects text extraction accuracy
- Complex citation formats may require manual verification
- Style detection confidence varies with citation complexity
- Network-dependent features require internet connectivity
- Rate limiting prevents excessive external service calls

TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------
Common Issues:

- **References not updating**: 
  - Make sure to click "Re-analyze Citations" after editing content
  - Try "Force Refresh" if the text area seems unresponsive
  - Check the debug information for content length changes
- **No references found**: Check PDF has extractable text and reference content (tool now handles headers with page numbers, section numbers, and headerless references)
- **Text area not responding**: Use "Force Refresh" button to reset the widget state
- **Old content persisting**: Click "Reset to Original" to restore the original PDF content
- **Low confidence scores**: Complex or non-standard citation formats may need manual review
- **Style inconsistencies**: Mixed citation styles require editorial attention
- **Network errors**: Check internet connection for external validation features


Interactive Re-analysis Tips:

- Edit content directly in the text area to fix extraction issues
- Add reference headers manually if not detected: "References", "Bibliography"
- Fix concatenated headers: change "19REFERENCES" to "19 REFERENCES"
- Separate merged references into individual lines
- Remove non-reference content like "(No references available)"


For best results:
- Use PDFs with clear, machine-readable text
- Reference sections can now be detected even without clear headers
- Supports various reference formats: [1], 1., plain numbers, Author et al.
- Tool handles prefixed headers like "Page 15 References" or "7. References"
- Use consistent citation style throughout document
- Utilize the interactive editing feature for challenging formats

TECHNICAL SUPPORT
----------------
This tool is designed for academic and research purposes. For technical issues:

1. Verify PDF quality and text extractability
2. Check citation format against standard style guides  
3. Review debug information in application tabs
4. Use manual verification options when automated detection fails
